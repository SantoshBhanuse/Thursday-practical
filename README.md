1. We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B.
Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same
name which returns the percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects
as its parameters for student B. Create an object for eac of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for both the students.

2. Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'.
The output should be as follows:
Name       Year of joining      Salary             Address

Sam        2000                 50000              68D- WallsStreat
John       1999                 54000              26B- WallsStrea
